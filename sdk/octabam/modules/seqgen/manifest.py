"""<Module name> -- one line on what it changes in the firmware.

THE SKELETON OF A COLDFIRE MODULE: code the build links and places for
you, reached from stock code by detours you name by SYMBOL. Copy this
directory to modules/<yourname>/ and edit. Directories starting with `_`
are skipped by the registry, so this file is never built.

modules/repitch/ is a finished one (one linked unit, detours, pokes);
modules/midi-scenes/ another (units built from the author's repository as
a submodule). docs/remixer/MODULES.md "Declaring a ColdFire
module" is the guide; docs/remixer/PLACEMENT.md says where the bytes go.

Say what the module is, which stock routines it changes, what is measured
and what is inferred. Delete every comment below once answered.
